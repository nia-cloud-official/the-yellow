      "Our team isn’t made up of interns or AI-generated “experts.” We’re engineers, artists, and designers who’ve shipped projects for Fortune 500 companies, indie game studios, and startups you’ve probably heard of. We’ve fixed code so broken it made seasoned developers cry, rescued games abandoned by other studios, and rebuilt websites that were actively losing customers.",

      "Most agencies focus on getting projects out the door. We focus on building systems that survive. Whether it’s a mobile game, a SaaS platform, or an e-commerce site, we architect solutions with scalability and maintenance in mind. No shortcuts, no spaghetti code, no “we’ll fix it later.” We’ve seen what happens when companies prioritize speed over stability—the result is always a dumpster fire.",

    description:
      "This isn’t a portfolio-building exercise for us. We measure success by your outcomes—not our creative vision. If a “boring” solution works better than a flashy one, we’ll fight for it. If your players hate microtransactions, we’ll find ethical ways to monetize. If your users struggle with your app, we’ll redesign it until they don’t. We’ve walked away from projects that demanded predatory design or half-baked code. Reputation matters more than revenue.",
